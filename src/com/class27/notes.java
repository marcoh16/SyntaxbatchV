	 * how they can be used?
	 * 
	 * method overloaing vs method overriding
	 * 
	 * method overloading- same method but different parameter within same class
	 * method overriding- same method name and same parameters(orders, numbers)
	 * 
	 * return type-overloaing- return type can be differnt since return type is not part of method signature
	 * return type-overring- must be the same
	 * 
	 * to overload we do need inheritanve
	 * to override inheritance is a must
	 * 
	 * static method can be overloaded, final and private aswell
	 * they can not be overriden
	 * 
	 * constructors can be overloaded while cant be overriden
	 * 
	 * in overloaind no restrictions to acvess modifiers, wjile in overriden 
	 * the scope/visibility cant be reduced (can be same, or reduce)
